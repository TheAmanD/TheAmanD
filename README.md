# Hey guys, Am here!

<img src="./assets/amityblush.gif" align="left" height="96px">

I'm ``Amity`` (my alias) and in short-form, ``Am``.<br>
I'm studying in the digital track of my *totally prestigious secondary school*. Currently in my second year.

## The things about me <img src="assets/family-guy-css.gif" align="right" height="256px">

I'm just your average burnt-out gifted kid from your secondary school.
That guy who gets stressed for making **Scratch** games.

I'm currently learning about web development, mainly HTML, CSS, PHP and others, but I might start learning on another programming language and make a game out of it, I guess. ``¯\_(ツ)_/¯``  
And yes, I can't live without Stack Overflow. /lh

Fav character's Amity Blight, hence mah name!
