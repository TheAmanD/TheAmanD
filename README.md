# Hey guys, Am here!

<img src="./assets/amityblush.gif" style="height:128px;">

I'm ``Aman`` (phonetic: ɑmɑn) *(not "A man", but still a guy nonetheless)*, preferred to be called as ``Amity`` and in short-form, ``Am``.<br>
I'm studying in the digital track of my *totally prestigious secondary school*. Currently in my second year.

## The things about me

I'm just your average burnt-out gifted kid from your secondary school.
That guy who gets stressful for making **Scratch** games.

I'm currently learning about web development, mainly HTML, CSS, PHP and others,
but I might start learning on another programming language and make a game out of it, I guess. ``¯\_(ツ)_/¯``

Fav character's Amity Blight, hence mah name!
